Simple Amiga-1200 membrane keyboard adapter to be use with QMK firmware:
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/converter/a1200/teensy2pp

Requires a Teensy 2++ board to interface with the Amiga keyboard.

Since the 31 pin connector for the A1200 membrane is very difficult to find, a 32 pin connector is used. The membrane must be pushed all the way towards the left side of the connector leaving pin 32 free/unconnected.

A 40 pin DIL footprint is used to fit the Teensy 2++ board.
